## Summary
PHPCodeHero is a Ruby on Rails application providing beginner PHP tutorials for users to code along with to 'level-up' and become PHP code heroes. 

## User Story
Learning to code is hard and many beginners rely on videos, articles and tutorials to help them practice and solidify their knowledge. PHPCodeHero users are beginners looking to learn basic PHP in a fun (superhero-themed) way. The only requirements for users is the ability to read and follow directions. Each lesson will walk a user through a concept, ask a question based on that concept and then allow the user to type their answer into an interactive console. From there PHPCodeHero will check their answer and either give them an opportunity to correct bugs or move on (or 'level up') to the next concept.
